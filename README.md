# My Chat App

## Descrition

This is a simple realtime chat app made by HTML, CSS, and Node.js. The design is not fancy cuz I'm still learning CSS.

## Features

It supports multiple user chatting at the same time with notification sound. To simulate it, open multiple instances in browser and join in with different user name.

## How to use

npm install -g nodemon

cd .\nodeServer\

nodemon .\index.js
